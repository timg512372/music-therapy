                        identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
                        privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being

                        The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
                        in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
                        role in the development of data protection laws around the globe.
                        Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should

                        collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle
                        requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data
                        users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or a government
